LRU Cache Implementation - Java
A simple Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache implementation in Java using Doubly Linked List (CDLL) and HashMap.

Features:
* Efficient O(1) time complexity for get() and put().
* Uses CDLL for ordering and a HashMap for fast lookups.
* Automatically removes the least recently used item when the cache is full.
